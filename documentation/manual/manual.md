# 3. Assembly &amp; Set up

Raspberry Pi Compute Module

Place the SODIMM-200 Raspberry Pi Compute Module in the dedicated socket on the rear of the board (for visual reference, see device mapping, 30). Make sure the two side clips are gripping the module on its dedicated half-circular holes.

RTC coin-cell battery

Place the coin-cell battery in its socket (mapping 26) with the positive polarity side facing upwards.

Mini PCI express

The balena Fin comes with two nylon press-fit elements pre-mounted for full-size mini PCI express modules. Just slide the module in the connector and press it so that its holes fit the nylon elements. You can remove or reposition them for half-sized mini PCI express by pressing the tip with a pliers and pull from the other side. Then just press it back in its new position until the tip is secured on the other end

External Antenna

You can attach an external antenna on the uFL socket (mapping 15). In order to enable the external antenna, you also need to slide the physical switch (mapping 33) to the ON position

Power

You can power the balena Fin from either a 5.5/2.1mm Barrel Jack (mapping 24) with positive polarity on the middle element or the Phoenix connector (mapping 23). The negative polarity of the Phoenix connector is labeled on the PCB with a "-" symbol. You can also power the balena Fin from the 5V pins exposed by the HAT connector, 2.5A are required as per the HAT specification.

# 4. Developer Instructions

## Flashing CM3L on Balena Fin

The balena Fin supports the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 **lite** (CM3L).

"Lite" means that the module itself has the eMMC socket unpopulated and the traces are exposed via SODIMM-200. This is very important since the standard CM3 has a fixed 4GB eMMC. Instead, with the CM3L, the balena Fin can expose variable storage sizes via its embedded eMMC wired to the CM3L via the SODIMM-200 pins.

_NOTE: Any recent OS distribution (2018+) for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B should be compatible with the balena Fin. This includes Raspbian and resinOS 2.x targeting the "Balena Fin" device-type._

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides a tool that allows the Compute Module to expose the eMMC as a mass storage device that can be flashed like any other media. We implemented this feature directly in Etcher by developing our own native nodeJS implementation, which is currently up to 3 times faster. This feature is available on [E](https://etcher.io/)[tcher](https://etcher.io/)starting from version 1.2.1 for OSX and Windows (Windows still needs the Raspberry Pi Foundation [usbboot](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/blob/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe) drivers installed, but we are working on integrating the drivers into Etcher in an upcoming release).

_If you want to use the tool provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation instead, please follow their instructions_ [_here_](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md)_._

Once you have everything set up on your computer, run Etcher on your computer, connect your balena Fin via CM3L Debug port (22) and power it from the POWER IN port (12).

_NOTE: a CM3L module needs to be inserted in the balena Fin!_

After a couple of seconds, the balena Fin eMMC should be detected on your computer by Etcher, which will initialize and list the board as a Compute Module based device (the name might change in the future). Proceed as usual, select the image you want to write, and press the "Flash!" button.

![Etcher enumerating the Balena Fin](https://github.com/resin-io/balena-fin/raw/master/documentation/manual/pictures/etcher_usbboot.png)

After flash is complete, power off your balena Fin and unplug the DEBUG micro-USB cable. Powering the balena Fin on will now result in the device booting from the freshly-written eMMC.

_NOTE: On managed resinOS, if you configured networking correctly on the resin.io dashboard while downloading the image to flash, this is the point when the device provisions and shows up in your application dashboard. If the device fails to connect to the configured WiFi SSID, the usual 4-blinks pattern will be shown on the ACT status LED_

## Installing specific Hardware support

**Generic instructions for raspbian 2018-06-27 or later:**

- Copy [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IitHX78mQX1CHV98Dj15sqhv4akNMPYE)file in the boot partition

_You can access the boot partition of your balena Fin by simply attaching it to your computer with the DBG micro USB cable, power it up and open Etcher. It will detect and mount the partition for you!_

- Add the following line to your config.txt

        dtoverlay=balena-fin

- Put [this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wQTOvX4vS_mrkl6iSbfFqycAFdAK-pr2) in /lib/firmware/mrvl/ and reboot ( this is the wifi+BT firmware. A more elegant way of adding it, is to add stretch-backports to your sources and then install it via apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install firmware-libertas )

**resinOS / resin.io instructions:**

- Download the Balena Fin (CM3) device type image (on resin.io, create a Balena Fin (CM3) application first):

![Fin device type on resin.io](https://github.com/resin-io/balena-fin/raw/master/documentation/manual/pictures/fin_device_type.png)

- Flash and boot your device.

## Programming Artik020 on Balena Fin

The Artik020 SWDIO interface is exposed to the CM3L via a FTDI FT2232H-56Q JTAG USB controller. This means that the Artik020 can be flashed from the CM3L via, for example, openOCD. A reference can be found [here](https://github.com/resin-io-modules/FT2232H-56Q-openocd).

_NOTE: A firmata-based firmware and client library is under development. This will allow users to easily interact with the co-processor from the CM3L without needing to write their own firmware._

## Using the RTC from CM3L

The balena Fin sports a very common I2C RTC module that is well known, supported, and documented within the Raspberry Pi ecosystem: the **DS1307.**

There are plenty of guides on how to interact with the chip, including the following:

- [https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time)
- [https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/17209332-adding-a-real-time-clock-to-your-raspberry-pi](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/17209332-adding-a-real-time-clock-to-your-raspberry-pi)

## Controlling the RGB LED

- `echo 504 > /sys/class/gpio/export # (Red)`
- `echo 505 > /sys/class/gpio/export # (Green)`
- `echo 506 > /sys/class/gpio/export # (Blue)`
- `echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio504/direction`
- `echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio505/direction`
- `echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio506/direction`

Now that you have the 3 GPIO LED pins ready, you can define your target color by setting each LED to high or low. For example, to turn the RGB off:

- `echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio504/value`
- `echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio505/value`
- `echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio506/value`

## Toggling the Status LED bank

This device sports 9 status LEDs varying from power, eMMC, ethernet, WiFi, WAN, etc. There is a switch which allows users to toggle them all on and off via software.

- `echo 511 > /sys/class/gpio/export`
- `echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio511/direction`
- `echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio511/value # turn off`
- `echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio511/value # turn on`

## Cellular via mPCIe card

We are working on identifying and documenting cards known to work out of the box on the board. If you plan on adding LTE capability to the device, we suggest the Quectel EC20EA-MINIPCIE: the card is known to work out of the box, hence only APN configuration is required. On ResinOS (2.0.0+) you do so by adding a NetworkManager profile in the boot partition under the "system-connections" folder. You can find more info about this on our docs at:[https://docs.resin.io/deployment/network/2.0.0/#cellular-modem-setup](https://docs.resin.io/deployment/network/2.0.0/#cellular-modem-setup).

![Fin bottom with mPCIe modem](https://github.com/resin-io/balena-fin/raw/master/documentation/manual/pictures/fin_bottom_modem.jpg)

Disabling RF activity on mPCIe radio cards

- `echo 508 > /sys/class/gpio/export`
- `echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio508/direction`
- `echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio508/value # mPCIe on`
- `echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio508/value # mPCIe off`

Disabling HDMI

- `echo 507 > /sys/class/gpio/export`
- `echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio507/direction`
- `echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio507/value # HDMI off`
- `echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio507/value # HDMI on`

## Power saving

- Turn off HDMI when not required
- Turn off the STATUS LEDs bank
- Programmatically disable RF activity on mPCIe when not required (assumes a cellular modem is being used)
- Programmatically power on and off the CM3L when not required via the co-processor PIN PC9 (5V interface) and PIN PF5 (3.3V interface). This is the equivalent of unplugging power from the Raspberry Pi

_NOTE: A firmata-based firmware and client library is under development. This will allow users to easily interact with the co-processor from the CM3L without needing to write their own firmware._

## Troubleshooting

If the Balena Fin does not appear in the Resin dashboard upon powering the device on, you may want to check the list below for potential issues.

- Check that the ResinOS image flashed to the Fin has the correct SSID and password for your WLAN network 
  - A pattern of 4-blinks on the ACT status LED indicates that the Fin cannot connect to a network
- Ensure that the WLAN radio physical switch (mapping 33) is set to the OFF position if you are **not** using an external antenna
- Verify that the power supply can maintain a minimum of 6 V (ideally 1.5 A or above) when powering the device from the Phoenix (mapping 23) or Barrel Adapters (mapping 24)
   - If USB1 ON and USB2 ON Status LEDs (mapping 18 & 23) are not turned ON, it is an indicator that the power supply may be insufficient for powering the Fin
   - The board may still power on if a low current or voltage is supplied, however the peripherals such as the Ethernet may not function correctly.
